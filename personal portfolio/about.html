                    Hello! My name is <span class="highlight">Anu Roy</span>, and I am a passionate and dedicated 
                    <span class="highlight">Web Developer</span> and <span class="highlight">Android Developer</span>. 
                    I have experience in building intuitive, dynamic, and responsive web and mobile applications. 
                    I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) and constantly exploring new 
                    technologies to expand my knowledge and skill set.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my journey so far, I’ve developed projects such as <span class="highlight">FlashApp</span>, a 
                    fast-delivery application, and honed my skills in technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, 
                    and Android development. I am enthusiastic about solving real-world problems with technology 
                    and contributing to innovative projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, you can find me reading about GenAI trends, exploring DevOps, or trying 
                    out new recipes in my free time. Feel free to check out my projects or reach out to me for collaborations!
